Welcome to my website. I work in the Risk Management space in financial services industry. 

I love deriving insights from data. That includes working on risk management in my day job and on financial markets data in my spare time. I enjoy valuing public/private companies and developing/validating data driven strategies. This blog is an attempt to share my work and learn from the feedback. Hope you enjoy it as well.
