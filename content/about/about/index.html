<p>Welcome to my website. I work in the Risk Management space in financial services industry.</p>
<p>I love deriving insights from data. That includes working on risk management in my day job and on financial markets data in my spare time. I enjoy valuing public/private companies and developing/validating data driven strategies. This blog is an attempt to share my work and learn from the feedback. Hope you enjoy it as well. I can be reached at <a href="mailto:sarathn@gmail.com" class="email">sarathn@gmail.com</a></p>
